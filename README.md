### Bugs
- Navigation Bugs 
   - If the user clicked the Register menu option while on the home page, it took the user to the Events page instead of the Register page.
      - This bug was due to linking the Events page to the Register menu option on navigation section. It was easily fixed by linking the correct page; Register file to the designated menu option.
